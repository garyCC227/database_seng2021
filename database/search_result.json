Seating with very good view of the stage from all levels, with the right elevation to not be obstructed by the person in front of you, unless you are unfortunate enough to have a rather tall lad sit in front of you. Acoustics are impeccable. The setting is very grand and truly fits the occasion. Looking forward to the next musical.",

Contrary to what is thought, not every concert means paying through the nose.\nGreat audience. And the romantic saunter to the Theatre from the Helix Bridge is great foreplay.

I used my hand fan but that wasn't enough. When I reached the Sentosa stop I went to the ticket counter and asked for a refund for the return. I was told that I couldn't receive a refund because, I rode the cable car. Of course I wouldn't have ridden it if the staff had said the temperature would NOT cool down. I don't like to post non-positive reviews but, as a traveler this is information I would have found important before I had made my decision to take the Singapore Cable Car.",

My Segway stopped working , I fell at the middle of the tour and NOONE helped me. Their staff left me alone bleeding at the side of the road where I fell. They were more concerned about the Segway that stopped working than on me. \n\nNoone knew how to do first aid and they did not have facilities for such. I was led to this dark alley where I had to wash my wounds and do my own first aid with the little supplies that they had. \n\nTheir supervisor, MUHD YUSUF, was not helpful. I called for the supervisor three times but he was arrogant enough to ignore that an accident happened. No one showed any concern and no one apologised. There was this one female staff who offered to help me but I did not allow her because she did not even wash her hands not wore gloves before handling my wound dressings. \n\nFor the rest of my lifetime, I'll have these scars on my elbow  and knee to remind me of this company's bad service. I don't mind getting wounded, but it just frustrating to receive bad customer service and poor treatment.\n\nI reported about this incident to Sentosa Management, and no one replied. GoGreen is a designated first aid station for the island, yet it had no facilities or staff with skills to provide such service. \n\nJoin this tour at your own risk. It's expensive and not worth at all. If you injure yourself, you are to be left to your own.",

We saw so much that we could go around nearly a second time in the hour provided.  The walkways are also so smooth and segway-friendly which allows for constant riding.   Word of warning:   you need to share the pathways with unpredictable selfie-addicts so expect them to do anything in front of you as they are totally unaware that you are there.   Enjoy.",

However we were treated very rudely at the entrance ( like that we didn\u2019t want to pay ?!) and we were shouted at by a staff in front of at least 30 people. \n\nThe entrance counter was badly managed and it was a mess . They took some tickets from us and let us in . Then later they realised they needed another set of tickets from us. \n\nA member of staff , a lady in white shirt was very rude and sarcastic to us . She and a few member of staffs are unable to empathise customers (my toddler was crying as they wanted me leave the queue and find the right set of tickets , isn\u2019t that their responsibility to get it right the first time before I entered?!)\n\nThis experience leave us a very bad impression of Sentosa and even Singapore. \n\nThe show itself was forced and acting was bad. Thirty minutes is a big waste of time. \n\nUse your time and money to visit other attraction !",

The redemption of tickets are troublesome , needed to queue up in 3 different places in order to finally get into the museum . \n\nWe have a toddler with stroller. Before the redemption of tickets , there were nobody (at 3 different queues , they all saw us with stroller ) told us that stroller is not allowed . Only after we redempted our tickets then they said no stroller is allowed , which is very inconvenient for us as my toddler won\u2019t able to walk long way. They should have put a notice in front or at least let us know before we redempt our tickets . \n\nThe staff at the entrance is not efficient too. They let our family in , after we walked quite a long way (without stroller holding my toddler) they suddenly told me they forgot to take my recipt earlier! (I was so confused that aren\u2019t they supposed to take it while I was walking in) I had to walk all the way back to outside the building to the stroller to get the receipt that they needed to keep for record. \n\nThere was a lady (I believe she is the manger of the front staffs) was very rude to us too. It is definitely not what I expected in Sentosa which is a tourist place that staffs there should be polite and welcoming. Big disappointment! \n\nThe acting of staff inside the museum is over-acting and the 30 mins acting was quite boring. I would prefer either they just tell us the history or I can read it on the wall myself. Basically you are forced to sit through the 30 mins bad acting . There is a sign said once you are in, you cannot exit half way. I wanted to leave as soon as I walked in. \n\nWill not recommend this place as it just not worth wasting time.",

Located in Little India, it is easily accessible via MRT to all other areas in Singapore. I took a taxi to and from the airport, approx $15. \n\nRoom was super nice and bed was great. I was given a handicap room - I was not a fan as I prefer a standard bath and I'm not handicap. Breakfast was included in my rate and it was a wonderful way to start my sightseeing days. Another perk for staying in this hotel was spa access. I basically had the thermal suite pool all to myself.\n\nOverall it was a great stay and well worth the splurge.",

Located in the historic Katong and Joo Chiat heritage district, the hotel will transport you back in time with its authentic Peranakan d\u00e9cor and furniture. Look a little closer and you might even be able to see the different Malay, Indian, Arabic, and European influences that played a part in shaping this unique culture.\n \nIn the immediate vicinity, you can effortlessly live like a local and see how the Peranakans left their mark on everything from design to cuisine as you stroll past old shophouses and visit authentic Peranakan restaurants. Go just a little farther out and the old will soon give way to the new at the nearby Parkway Parade shopping mall, a subtle reminder that modern conveniences are never far away when you stay at Village Hotel Katong.",

The chef was on hand and happily explained any dishes we were unfamiliar with. A problem with the evening meal was dealt with and resolved to our satisfaction by the restaurant supervisor. \nA good location near to an underground station meant we could easily explore the city.  Quality shopping on Orchard Road just outside\nThoroughly recommend.",

I used my hand fan but that wasn't enough. When I reached the Sentosa stop I went to the ticket counter and asked for a refund for the return. I was told that I couldn't receive a refund because, I rode the cable car. Of course I wouldn't have ridden it if the staff had said the temperature would NOT cool down.

I expected less from this museum, but was impressed to see loaned masterpieces from European galleries, like d'Orsay. At time of our visit (March 2018) there was a special exhibition, showing masterpieces from Monet, Renoir, Juan Luna and others. The building itself is a spectacular, Neoclassical in style, but too large for the pieces of art i offers. An hour is enough to take at look at the most prominent pictures.",

Also, they do not mention the importance of having to completely cover your hair. Not kidding, but I spent 2 whole days trying to entangle my hair and almost went crazy! Had to pull them apart strand by strand and now my hair is in shackles ! \n\nMake sure you ask a lot of questions before doing the actual sky-dive. \n\nThe experience was pretty good. And is a superb simulation of the wind pressure up there. Other than that, it's not worth so much of your money... (And a lot of hair!!)",

You can enjoy the exhibits and pop into one of their many restaurants. I was surprised to find good food for a pretty decent amount in one of the cafes.",

However we were treated very rudely at the entrance ( like that we didn\u2019t want to pay ?!) and we were shouted at by a staff in front of at least 30 people. \n\nThe entrance counter was badly managed and it was a mess . They took some tickets from us and let us in . Then later they realised they needed another set of tickets from us. \n\nA member of staff , a lady in white shirt was very rude and sarcastic to us . She and a few member of staffs are unable to empathise customers (my toddler was crying as they wanted me leave the queue and find the right set of tickets , isn\u2019t that their responsibility to get it right the first time before I entered?!)\n\nThis experience leave us a very bad impression of Sentosa and even Singapore. \n\nThe show itself was forced and acting was bad. Thirty minutes is a big waste of time. \n\nUse your time and money to visit other attraction !",

The redemption of tickets are troublesome , needed to queue up in 3 different places in order to finally get into the museum . \n\nWe have a toddler with stroller. Before the redemption of tickets , there were nobody (at 3 different queues , they all saw us with stroller ) told us that stroller is not allowed . Only after we redempted our tickets then they said no stroller is allowed , which is very inconvenient for us as my toddler won\u2019t able to walk long way. They should have put a notice in front or at least let us know before we redempt our tickets . \n\nThe staff at the entrance is not efficient too. They let our family in , after we walked quite a long way (without stroller holding my toddler) they suddenly told me they forgot to take my recipt earlier! (I was so confused that aren\u2019t they supposed to take it while I was walking in) I had to walk all the way back to outside the building to the stroller to get the receipt that they needed to keep for record. \n\nThere was a lady (I believe she is the manger of the front staffs) was very rude to us too. It is definitely not what I expected in Sentosa which is a tourist place that staffs there should be polite and welcoming. Big disappointment! \n\nThe acting of staff inside the museum is over-acting and the 30 mins acting was quite boring. I would prefer either they just tell us the history or I can read it on the wall myself. Basically you are forced to sit through the 30 mins bad acting . There is a sign said once you are in, you cannot exit half way. I wanted to leave as soon as I walked in. \n\nWill not recommend this place as it just not worth wasting time.",

Lined with an eclectic mix of generations-old heritage stores, independent boutiques and crafts shops, Kampong Glam?s shophouses are a welcome change from air-conditioned shopping centres. Much of its charm as the former home of the local Sultan (King) has been retained, yet new tenants inject fresh allure into one of Singapore?s most iconic heritage neighbourhoods. Wander through back alleys and along five-foot ways offering trinkets that you won?t usually find in any malls. Start from the shops around the biggest landmark, Sultan Mosque, and work your way into the narrow alleyways that are full of curious finds.",

The Chinese restaurant is helmed by Chef Lau Siaw Dee, who previously won an award at an international culinary event coinciding with the Beijing Olympics. The restaurant is brightly lit, with sufficient breathing space between the simple wood furnishings. MUST TRIES: The restaurant is best known for its Teochew style Lobster Porridge(S$31.90, half a lobster), which consists of loose rice grains cooked in a simmering golden broth, enriched with lobster roe and served with a meaty lobster half. The Crispy Lotus Root with Salted Egg also makes for a good snack before the meal.",

You can order the usual northeastern Chinese fare but they just make everything better, not overly salty, not overly greasy (as long as you don't order Sichuan inspired dishes) and very generous portions. First ate here 2 weeks ago and I've gone back 4 times since, if you think all Chinese food is stirfried and greasy, go to this place and order from the appetizer/cold dish menu. Oh and they make dumplings too. Yes they accept credit card.",

You can try some quite interesting local beers too.\n\nThe staff are knowledgeable and polite and they know what they are selling. They can give you good advice if you tell them your taste.\n\nThe atmosphere is excellent. It's very clean and there is plenty of natural light. I wish they didn't try to turn up the music volume though. Otherwise, the music selection is good.\n\nAgain, like in Druggists, I wish they offered some nuts like salty peanuts or salty almonds. This would go perfect with these beers. Most people who love craft beer and go there because of the beer, they just need to have some simple salty nuts, not those \"fancy\" fried food. Nuts are simple and they wouldn't even need a cook or kitchen for that.\n\nThe lack of nuts is the only downside though, otherwise I highly recommend this bar to anyone who loves beer.",

The museum expands on the connections between Dr Sun and Singapore in five galleries with artefacts, artworks and multimedia exhibits. Free guided tours in English and Mandarin are available on selected days on a first-come, first-served basis. There is a 20% discount for purchases of 20 or more adult tickets.

The brainchild of antique collector and owner Alvin Yapp, The Intan (meaning 'rose-cut diamond' in Malay) enlightens its guests about the multi-facetted aspects of Peranakan culture through a kaleidoscope of rare historical artefacts, intriguing personal stories, and authentic dining experiences. Located in the heart of Joo Chiat, a traditional Peranakan enclave and Singapore\u2019s \ufb01rst heritage town (2011), The Intan offers personalised tours conducted by Alvin, which culminate with authentic Peranakan tea sessions and dinners inspired by his mother. The Intan also doubles up as a unique event space, having hosted a variety of activities that included jewellery exhibitions, art shows and violin recitals. Awarded Best Tour Experience by Singapore Tourism Awards 2016 and voted Best Overall Experience in Singapore\u2019s inaugural Museum Roundtable Awards, The Intan has been featured internationally on CNN Travel, Discovery Channel and National Geographic. Singapore Travelholic lists The Intan as the top 5 Peranakan activities to do in Singapore.

Services were held at the Town Hall (today\u2019s Victoria Memorial Hall) until the first chapel opened a year later. In recognition of the church\u2019s contribution to mission work and education, Singapore\u2019s then-governor Sir John Anderson granted it a piece of land in 1907. This is the exact piece of land at Fort Canning (today\u2019s site) of Wesley Methodist Church. It was styled after English Gothic buildings, featuring exposed brickwork. First known as Methodist Episcopal Church, it was renamed after John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, in 1910. Membership has soared since then, and the church has undergone several renovations to extend its premises. Opening Hours: Mon-Sun, 9am-6pm; Closed on Public Holidays, the day after Easter Sunday and the day after Christmas Day.",
