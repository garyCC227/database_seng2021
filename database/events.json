Each performance is followed by a complimentary sharing by a Shakespeare theatre veteran.</p><p><br></p><p><b>The Merchant of Venice</b></p><p> \n\nBy William Shakespeare\n</p><p> \n\nDirected by award winning&nbsp;Polly Findlay\n</p><p> \n\nWednesday, 12 June, 7.30pm</p><p> \n\nApproximate running time: 2hrs 15mins\n</p><p>In the melting pot of Venice, trade is God. With its ships plying the globe, the city opens its arms to all, as long as they come prepared to do business and there is profit to be made.\n</p><p> \n\nWith the gold flowing all is well, but when a contract between Bassanio and Shylock is broken, simmering racial tensions boil over. A wronged father and despised outsider, Shylock looks to exact the ultimate price for a deal sealed in blood. </p><p><br></p><p><b>\n \n \n \n\n\n\nHamlet\n</b></p><p> \n\nBy William Shakespeare\n</p><p> \n\nDirected by Simon Godwin\n</p><p> \n\nThursday, 13 June, 7.30pm\n</p><p>\nApproximate running time: 3hrs\n</p><p>\nHamlet has the world at his feet. Young, wealthy and living a hedonistic life studying abroad. Then word reaches him that his father is dead.\n</p><p>\nReturning home he finds his world is utterly changed, his certainties smashed and his home a foreign land. Struggling to understand his place in a new world order he faces a stark choice. Submit, or rage against the injustice of his new reality.\n</p><p>\nSimon Godwin (The Two Gentlemen of Verona 2014) directs Paapa Essiedu as Hamlet in Shakespeare\u2019s searing tragedy. As relevant today as when it was written, Hamlet confronts each of us with the mirror of our own mortality in an imperfect world.\n</p><p><br></p><p><b>\n\n\nOthello\n</b></p><p>\nBy William Shakespeare\n</p><p>\nDirected by Iqbal Khan</p><p> Friday, 14 June, 7.30pm\n</p><p>\nApproximate running time: 3hrs\n</p><p>\nOthello is the greatest general of his age. A fearsome warrior, loving husband and revered defender of Venice against its enemies.\n</p><p>\nBut he is also an outsider whose victories have created enemies of his own, men driven by prejudice and jealousy to destroy him. As they plot in the shadows, Othello realises too late that the greatest danger lies not in the hatred of others, but his own fragile and destructive pride.\n</p><p>\nAfter more than a decade working in film and television on projects from Star Wars to Holby City, Hugh Quarshie returns to the RSC to play Shakespeare's Othello. He was last seen with us in Faust and Julius Caesar (1996). Hugh will play opposite Lucian Msamati in the role of Iago, returning to the RSC following his role as Pericles in 2006. The production is directed by Iqbal Khan (Much Ado About Nothing, 2012).</p><p></p>",
