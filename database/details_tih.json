VIP services upgraded me to a skyline suite, experienced fantastic service.. however this was dampened by their poor handling of parking coupons. Asked for parking coupons for my guests but was outrightly rejected with a 1 coupon per room policy reason. Had to explain to my guests which put me in a spot. Was told by concierge that Pan Pacific guests faced this issue before, but they didn't seemed to have structured a solution quickly to solve it. Eventually I reimbursed my guests myself to save the waiting time. Looks like paying for a suite doesn't get you a guaranteed 5 star service. FYI, I have never faced this at other local hotels before.",

I used my hand fan but that wasn't enough. When I reached the Sentosa stop I went to the ticket counter and asked for a refund for the return. I was told that I couldn't receive a refund because, I rode the cable car. Of course I wouldn't have ridden it if the staff had said the temperature would NOT cool down.

This is way more economical than printing 1 or 2 photos for $20 at other attraction places. Amazed also that you can check your photos by scanning your helmet. Cheers to a good customer service!",
